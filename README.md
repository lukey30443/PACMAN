##Objective:
- The objective of Pac-Man is to navigate a maze, eat all the dots (pellets), and avoid being caught by the ghosts. Your goal is to clear the maze of all dots while avoiding being caught by the ghosts to advance to the next level.

##Controls:

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) on your keyboard to control Pac-Man's movement within the maze.
You can also use the WASD keys for movement, depending on the game version.
Game Elements:

- Pac-Man: You control Pac-Man, a yellow, circular character that moves through the maze.
Ghosts: There are colorful ghosts chasing Pac-Man. They will try to catch and eliminate him.
Dots (Pellets): The maze is filled with small dots (white pellets). Eating all the dots is your primary goal.
Power Pellets (Power Pills): In the corners of the maze, there are larger, flashing dots (power pellets). Eating a power pellet temporarily turns the ghosts blue and vulnerable. When they are blue, Pac-Man can eat them for extra points.
Fruit: Occasionally, fruit appears in the maze for bonus points. Eating fruit adds extra points to your score.
Gameplay:

- Start by pressing the "Start" button or key (often Enter or Spacebar) to begin the game.
Control Pac-Man's movement using the arrow keys or WASD keys to navigate through the maze.
Your main objective is to eat all the dots in the maze. As you eat dots, your score increases.
Be cautious of the ghosts. If a ghost touches Pac-Man, you lose a life.
Eating a power pellet will turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable for a limited time. During this time, you can eat the blue ghosts to earn extra points.
Try to eat as many dots as possible, avoid the ghosts, and collect fruit for bonus points.
Your game continues until you lose all your lives, typically indicated by a counter at the bottom of the screen.
To win, clear all the dots from the maze and advance to the next level. The game becomes faster and more challenging with each level.
Scoring:

Eating dots: Points are awarded for each dot you eat.
Eating blue ghosts: Points are awarded for eating vulnerable ghosts.
Eating fruit: Collecting fruit provides bonus points.
Tips:

Plan your route to maximize dot collection and avoid ghosts.
Use power pellets strategically to eat ghosts.
Learn the patterns and behaviours of the ghosts to outmaneuver them.
Game Over:
The game ends when you lose all your lives. You can restart the game by pressing "Start" or the designated key.
